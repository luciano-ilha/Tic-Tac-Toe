## Game rules

- There are only 2 players.
- The board has 9 empty cells
- There are 2 pieces of tokens — X and O
- Players take turns playing by entering their token into empty cells.
- The first player to get 3 of his/her tokens in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
- The game ends in a draw if all 9 cells are occupied and there is no winner.

## How do we play Tic Tac Toe

- Players take turns playing.
- 1st turn — Player 1
- Player 1 places their token (X) in only 1 square of their choice (it has to be between 1 and 9, can't be letters, negative numbers, or a position already taken by the other player).
- 2nd turn — Player 2.
- Player 2 places their token (O) in only 1 square of their choice, except they can’t touch the square that Player 1’s token already fills.
- 3rd turn- Player 1 …. and the cycle continue until a player wins or there’s a tie game.
- There are 8 winning combinations: Top row, Middle row, Bottom row, Left column, Middle column, Right column, Left diagonal, and Right diagonal.
- There’s a draw/tie when the entire board is filled with X’s and O’s but no winning combinations can be found.
